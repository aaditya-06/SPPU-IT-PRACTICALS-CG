ASSIGNMENT NO. :03 
AIM: 
Implement Bresenham circle drawing algorithm to draw any object. The 
object should be displayed in all the quadrants with respect to center and 
radius 
PRE-REQUISITE: 
1. Knowledge of Library function of OpenGL. 
2. Knowledge of Graphical Characteristics of Rectangle and circle 
OBJECTIVE: 
1. To Learn Circle drawing algorithm 
THEORY: 
Bresenham’s Circle Drawing: 
A circle is a symmetrical figure. It has eight - way symmetry. If we know any 
single point of circle we can plot all remaining seven pixels using 8- way 
symmetry. This algorithm considers 8 –way symmetry of circle and generates 
the whole circle. 1/8th part of circle i.e. from 90° to 45° is drawn, during this 
x increments in positive direction and y increments in negative direction. In 
this algorithm we have to select proper pixel which is either on the circle or 
closed to the circle port. 
Decision Variable is given as d = 3 -2r

 Algorithm: 
Read radius (r) of the circle. 
Initialize Decision variable 
 d = 3 – 2r. 
Initialize Starting point 
x = 0, y = r 
do 
 { 
 Plot (x, y) 
 Plot (y, x) 
 Plot (y, - x) 
 Plot (x, - y) 
 Plot (- x, - y) 
 Plot (- y, - x) 
 Plot (- y, x) 
 Plot (- x, y) 
 if ( d < 0) 
 { 
 d = d + 4x + 6 
} 
 else 
 { 
 d = d + 4(x – y) + 10 
y = y – 1 
} 
x = x + 1

 } while (x < y) 
    Stop. 
Algorithm: 
1. Input radius r and circle center (xc,yc) , and obtain the first point on the 
circumference of the circle centered on the origin as 
 (x0, y0) = (0, r) 
2. Calculate the initial value of the decision parameter as 
P0 = 5/4 – r 
3. At each xk position, startin at k =0, perform the following test: If pk< 0, 
the next point along the circle centered on (0,0) is (xk + 1, yk) and 
4. Pk+1 = pk + 2xk+1 + 1 
5. Otherwise, the next point along the circle is (xk +1,yk-1) and 
Pk+1 = pk + 2xk+1 +1 – 2yk+1 
 Where 2xk+1 = 2xk +2 and 2yk+1 = 2yk -2. 
 6. Determine symmetry points in the other seven octants. Move each calculated 
pixel position (x,y) onto the circular path centered on (xc,yc) and plot the 
coordinate values: 
x= x + xc 
y = y + yc 
7. Repeat syeps 3 through 5 until x>=y
